                            scientific research to improve life back on Earth as well as raise awareness to a global
                            audience.
                            Find all the information you need to make a reservation online, everything from plate
                            configuration to technical specifications to licensing information. Once your reservation
                            request is approved, SpaceX will provide you with a welcome package outlining next steps for
                            launch.

                            Payloads are received at the launch site around L-30 and processed in a SpaceX facility.

                            alternative interface.With Starlink, users can engage in activities that historically have
                            not been possible with satellite internet.

                            Starlink’s high-speed, low-latency service is made possible via the world’s largest
                            constellation of highly advanced satellites operating in a low orbit around the Earth.
                            Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN15 was powered through ascent
                            by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee
                            – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN15 performed a propellant transition to the internal
                            header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a
                            controlled aerodynamic descent.

                            The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by
                            independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were
                            actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and
                            enabled precise landing at the intended location. SN15’s Raptor engines reignited as the
                            vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down for a nominal
                            landing on the pad.

                            These test flights of Starship are all about improving our understanding and development of
                            a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on
                            long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to
                            Mars and beyond.
