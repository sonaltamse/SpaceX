                        <P style="text-align: justify;">On Wednesday, May 5, Starship serial number 15 (SN15)
                            successfully completed SpaceX’s fifth high-altitude flight test of a Starship prototype from
                            Starbase in Texas.

                            Similar to previous high-altitude flight tests of Starship, SN15 was powered through ascent
                            by three Raptor engines, each shutting down in sequence prior to the vehicle reaching apogee
                            – approximately 10 km in altitude. SN15 performed a propellant transition to the internal
                            header tanks, which hold landing propellant, before reorienting itself for reentry and a
                            controlled aerodynamic descent.

                            The Starship prototype descended under active aerodynamic control, accomplished by
                            independent movement of two forward and two aft flaps on the vehicle. All four flaps were
                            actuated by an onboard flight computer to control Starship’s attitude during flight and
                            enabled precise landing at the intended location. SN15’s Raptor engines reignited as the
                            vehicle performed the landing flip maneuver immediately before touching down for a nominal
                            landing on the pad.

                            These test flights of Starship are all about improving our understanding and development of
                            a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo on
                            long-duration interplanetary flights, and help humanity return to the Moon, and travel to
                            Mars and beyond.

                            Congratulations to the entire SpaceX team on SN15’s successful flight and landing!
                            SpaceX’s Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket (collectively referred to as Starship)
                            represent a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to
                            Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond. Starship will be the world’s most powerful launch
                            vehicle ever developed, with the ability to carry in excess of 100 metric tonnes to Earth
                            orbit.Starship is the fully reusable spacecraft and second stage of the Starship system. It
                            offers an integrated payload section and is capable of carrying passengers and cargo to
                            Earth orbit, planetary destinations, and between destinations on Earth.The first stage, or
                            booster, of our next-generation launch system has a gross liftoff mass of over 3 million kg
                            and uses sub-cooled liquid methane and liquid oxygen (CH4/LOX) propellants. The booster will
                            return to land at the launch site on its 6 legs.
